## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Website won't open"
→ Make sure you're opening `.html` files, not folder

### "Links don't work"
→ Make sure all files are in the same folder

### "Images look wrong"
→ Emojis are used as images (intentional design)

### "Form not sending"
→ That's normal - it's frontend only. Backend needed for real submissions.

### "Mobile menu not working"
→ Resize browser window smaller to see hamburger menu
